    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Petruso Lytvyn's foot plunged through the rotten wood planks underneath him into the milky pool. It became dark and cloudy as the effluvia was agitated. Lifting his leg, the blasphemous biomatter clung to his boot. He recoiled, for it's appearance was wholly unnatural and sinister. He stomped and scraped his boot along the edge of a displaced floorboard, freeing his boot of most of the loathsome ichor.</p> 
        <p>Breathing heavily, he turned to investigate the substance. Shortly, his terror became curiosity. He regarded it for a moment. It's viscousness. The putrescent emanations. They were...alluring?<p>
        <p>He leaned in for a taste.<p>
